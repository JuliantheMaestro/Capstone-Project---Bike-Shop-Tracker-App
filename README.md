The premise of my project is to create an app for a local bike shop where new users can sign up and log in as a volunteer to track volunteer data. This app would be used at the entrance of the bike shop so users log in before working on bikes. Upon signing up giving out information like name, phone number, email and mechanical experience the app generates a random 4 digit ID that is not already in the database. With this new ID the new user can then log in using either the ID or the name they signed up with if they have forgotten their ID. For bike shop admins there is a speical page with a table displaying all of the current volunteers in the database. It also displays additional data like how many times each user has logged in. There is also a "Sync Calendar" button that makes a call to Google Calendars API and syncs the log in times for all of the users to a calendar. 

Integrated Features
- Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
